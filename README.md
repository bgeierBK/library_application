This is an application to manage inventory for a library that checks out both books and DVDs. To operate it, clone this repo to your IDE of choice and naviagate to the main file.
Next, run the file. As of now, only admins can create new users. To log in, go to the "Users" file and sign in as any of the dummy users that have been created.
From here, you can follow the instructions to view books or DVDs, check them out and return them. Thanks!
